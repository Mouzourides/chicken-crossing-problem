# Chicken-Fox-Corn Crossing Problem

You are a farmer taking a fox, a chicken and a sack of corn to market and you come across a river. 

The only way across the river is by a small boat, which can only hold at most you and one of the three items. 

Left unsupervised, the chicken will eat the corn or the fox will eat the chicken (however, the fox won't try to eat the grain, nor will the fox or the chicken wander off). 

What's the quickest way to get everything across the river?
